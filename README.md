# Penalty Tracker

The penalty tracker started off as a bet between myself and a couple friends in which we wanted to see what teams/players drew the most Embellishment (diving) penalties. From this, I learned that the NHL has a public API which has a similar structure to the way the MLB does it. Through this API I could easily pull the penalty data and store it in a locally managed database so that we could submit our own queries against it.

After we had our fun with it, I realized that others might want to as well. This project is the React front end for it. For the API, and eventually the documentation for it, look here. I am going to be documenting my thought process for each component, that will eventually be in the "Notes" section.
